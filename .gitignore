# CocoaPods
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

# fastlane
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo.
# Instead, use fastlane to re-generate them on demand.
# For more information see the fastlane docs:
